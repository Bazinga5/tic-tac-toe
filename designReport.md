Design Report for Tic Tac Toe
==============================

The assignment
----------------
For this assignment we chose to apply the agile methodology and TDD and feature branch workflow on GitHub. Our assignment was to create a simple version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. 

About the game
----------------
Tic Tac Toe is a two player game played on a 3x3 grid. Player 1 is assigned the character X and player 2 is assigned the character O. The player who gets a complete row, horizontal, vertical or a diagonal line of X or Y wins the game. There is a possibility of a tie between players. 

About our design 
----------------
We chose to implement the simplest version of this game. A two player human vs human game. As the game develops we thought that we could also implement a human vs. computer game but that feature is not included in this version.
